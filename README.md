# Advanced Visual Geometry Projects

Projects were developed as a team back in 2020/2021 using Python, OpenCV and Numpy.

Each project has:
* The source materials in the Materials folder (images and instructions)
* The Python code developed in the Code folder (.m scripts)

* A report of all 3 projects in the parent folder

To run a project:
* Run the Python scripts from the Terminal
